# Sports Analytics ML Project

### Background
- Part of a capstone project in my MS DS program.
- The purpose of the project was to create an end to end ML model then deploy it and display results. I decided to create a model around PLL (Premier Lacrosse Leage) team data.
- With a background in lacrosse this project was a great way to take a passion of mine and use it to showcase how analytics / ML can improve real world outcomes.

### Approach
- The goal of the model was to be able to project team performance through game by game metrics and stats.
- Once the feature set was identifed (elsewhere), I used the model to run what-if scenarios to model how small overarching improvements in specific categories could improve long term team performance.
- These notebooks are designed as if I was a Data Scientist working for a PLL team, I run through the modeling approach and then explain results at the end.

Enjoy!
